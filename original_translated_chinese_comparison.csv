1. Approximately two months before your work permit expires, your employer should apply for its renewal. They can do this through the MOM's online portal called myMOM Portal.

2. Your employer will need to log in to the myMOM Portal using their CorpPass account. If they don't have a CorpPass account, they can register for one on the MOM website.

3. Once logged in, your employer should navigate to the ""Work Permit Transactions"" section and select the option to renew your work permit.

4. They will need to provide the necessary information and documents, such as your passport details, employment contract, and any relevant medical examination reports.

5. After submitting the renewal application, your employer will receive an acknowledgment receipt. They should keep this receipt as proof of application.

6. The MOM will review the application and may request additional documents or information if needed.

7. If the renewal is approved, your employer will receive an In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter. This letter will contain instructions on how to collect your new work permit card.

8. You will need to make an appointment to collect your new work permit card at the MOM Services Centre. You can do this through the myMOM Portal or by calling the MOM hotline.

Remember, it is important to start the renewal process early to ensure that your work permit does not expire. If your work permit expires, you will not be allowed to continue working in Singapore. You can check the validity of your work permit by downloading the SGWorkPass app or by logging on to the MOM website.
